		<h2>programming languages ​​and tools</h2>
	<article>
		<p>Programming: I have experience with HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery. I have also worked with PHP, Python (Django), SQL, Java, C #, C + + and C. Also a little bit of Scheme, Smalltalk, and Standard ML.</p>
		<p>Environment and Tools: I have experience of working in Eclipse, Aptana, Code Blocks and Visual Studio. But as good as IDE's are, nothing compares to writing code in Sublime Text Editor.</p>
		<p>My University life has largely been carried out in Linux, Ubuntu. I love Linux!</p>
		<p>I have worked a lot with the Git version control. I have experience with CI service as Jenkins and Travis.</p>
		<p>I've experience working in Scrum, both in large projects in Software Engineering and also in the final project. I would love to work in an Agile environment and TDD developement.</p>
		<p>This list is not exhaustive and I am quick to learn new tools and programming languages.</p>
